## Inspiration
As programmers (and especially during the pandemic), we often find ourselves sitting down for too long. We were interested in a way for people to get active and to have fun at the same time as a little break in their work (like a "pomodoro game"). Since AR is a growing field and we were interested in seeing what we could make with AR, creating a game where the player has to get active by moving their head around to dodge things sounded fun and challenging, and so Sussy Balls was born! The game is Pokemon/Among Us/COVID-19 themed, since we were thinking of some of the most notable "themes" in the past year and how we could theme the falling projectiles (Pokeballs, Among Us astronauts, COVID-19).


## What it does
Most games on the web are played with a keyboard and mouse. This game is played with your face! We use AI to track your face live and you will use that to play. Whether you want to avoid being trapped in a Pokeball prison like you're Pikachu in the tall grass, trying to avoid COVID-19 like the plague, or avoiding the sussy bakas in your crew in space, this game will allow you to do all of that! This is the game to play for everyone who wants to get up from their chairs, laugh a little and get in their daily exercise as students and coders. We hope you enjoy this humorous, unique game.
